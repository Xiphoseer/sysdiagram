//! > DDS (DaVinci Design Surface) is an internal name for the design surface we used for our designers.
//! > It is originally developed by VS and I think it was also used for a few other designers too
//! > (like the UI designers in VS 6). It is a pretty old design surface and it will soon be replaced everywhere it was used.
